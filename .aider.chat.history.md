# Coding Style Guide

## General Style
1. Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions and types
2. Prefer explicit code over clever tricks
3. Document public APIs thoroughly with Rustdoc comments
4. Keep line lengths reasonable (typically under 100 chars)
5. Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
6. Place imports at top of file (except test modules)

## Rust Specifics
1. Use derive macros (Default, Debug) where appropriate
2. Implement traits explicitly rather than blanket impls when possible
3. Use Result types for error handling rather than panics
4. Document error conditions clearly in docs
5. Use generics and traits to create flexible APIs
6. Prefer atomic_refcell over Mutex for thread-safe interior mutability

## Documentation Style
1. Include examples in docs showing common usage
2. Document limitations and edge cases
3. Use markdown formatting in docs
4. Include crate-level docs explaining overall purpose
5. Document feature flags and their effects
6. Include maintainer/contact info in README

## Testing Style
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Test edge cases explicitly
3. Include wasm-bindgen-test for WASM compatibility
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Test both success and error paths
6. Benchmark performance-critical code

## Lessons Learned

1. The power of Rust's type system for safe ECS implementation:
   - TypeId for runtime type checking
   - Generics for flexible system functions
   - Traits for clean abstraction boundaries

2. Importance of clear error handling:
   - Distinct error types for different failure modes
   - Macros to simplify error creation
   - Documenting expected error conditions

3. Performance considerations:
   - AtomicRefCell for thread-safe access
   - Careful system staging for parallel execution
   - Benchmarking different approaches

4. API design principles:
   - Builder pattern for complex construction
   - Feature flags for opt-in complexity
   - Clear documentation of requirements/limitations

5. Testing methodology:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for combined behavior
   - WASM compatibility testing
   - Benchmarking performance characteristics

#### Add criterion to Cargo.toml and update the benchmarks to use criterion rather than the unstable built-in benchmark utility. The Latest version of criterion available is 0.6.0.  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

We are going to:
 1. Update Cargo.toml to add criterion under [dev-dependencies] and remove the bench feature since criterion doesn't require it.
 2. Rewrite the benchmark files to use criterion instead of the built-in test::Bencher.

 However, note that the current benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and have the following names:
   - benches/dispatcher.rs
   - benches/world.rs
   - benches/system.rs

 We'll create corresponding criterion benchmarks. Also, we can remove the `#![feature(test)]` and `extern crate test;` since criterion doesn't require them.

 Since the project already has a `benches` directory, we can keep the same structure.

 Steps for each benchmark file:
   - Remove the feature and extern crate test.
   - Remove the use of test::Bencher.
   - Use criterion_group and criterion_main to define the benchmark group.

 But note: The original benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and are built as separate executables.

 We'll update each benchmark file accordingly.

 However, we need to update Cargo.toml to remove the `feature(test)` and add criterion.

 Let's update Cargo.toml first.


</think>

We'll update the benchmarks to use Criterion instead of the built-in test bench. The changes include:

1. Adding the latest Criterion (0.6.0) as a dev dependency
2. Updating each benchmark file to use Criterion's API
3. Removing unstable features like `#![feature(test)]`

Here are the changes:

#### No benches were ran. find the issue and fix it.  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

We are seeing warnings about using the deprecated `criterion::black_box` and dead code in the benchmarks.
 Additionally, the benchmarks are not running because according to the output, the bench tests are being ignored.

 However, the main issue is that the benchmarks are not running. The output says:
   "Running unittests src/lib.rs ... 8 ignored"
   "Running benches/dispatcher.rs ... 0 tests"
   etc.

 This suggests that the benchmark files are not being recognized as benchmarks.

 In Criterion.rs, we use `criterion_main!` and `criterion_group!` to define the benchmarks.
 But note that the benchmark files must have a `main` function that is generated by `criterion_main!`.

 Looking at the files we have:

 benches/dispatcher.rs ends with:
   criterion_group!(benches, build_dispatcher, run_dispatcher);
   criterion_main!(benches);

 This should define a main function. However, the output says "running 0 tests".

 The issue might be that the benchmark files are not being compiled as benchmarks.

 In Cargo.toml, we have:
   [dev-dependencies]
   criterion = "0.6.0"

 But we haven't told Cargo about the benchmark files.

 We need to add a `[[bench]]` section in Cargo.toml for each benchmark.

 Alternatively, we can have one `[[bench]]` and then use multiple criterion groups? Actually, typically we have one benchmark per file and one [[bench]] per file.

 Let's change Cargo.toml to include:

 [[bench]]
 name = "dispatcher"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "system"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "world"
 harness = false

 But note: the current Cargo.toml does not have any `[[bench]]` sections.

 Without this, Cargo doesn't know to run the benches.

 Also, we are getting warnings about dead code and deprecated black_box.

 We should fix the deprecated black_box by replacing it with `std::hint::black_box` as suggested.

 And for the dead code, we can either remove the field or mark it as used. Since it's a benchmark, we can remove the field because it's just for demonstration.

 Let's break down the changes:

 1. Update Cargo.toml to include the benchmark sections.
 2. In each benchmark file, replace `criterion::black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`.
 3. Remove the unused fields in `benches/world.rs` to fix the dead code warning.

 However, note that the dead code warning is for `struct A(f32);` in benches/world.rs. We are using `A` in the benchmarks, but the field `0` is not used. We can change it to `struct A;` or use the field.

 Since the benchmark is about accessing the resource, we can use the field to avoid the dead code warning.

 Let's change in benches/world.rs:

 Instead of:
     struct A(f32);

 We can do:
     struct A(u32);
     ... and in the iteration, set it to some value and then read it.

 But that would change the benchmark. Alternatively, we can just ignore the warning with `#[allow(dead_code)]` or use the field.

 However, the warning suggests removing the field. So we can change to:

     struct A;

 But then we are not storing any data. The purpose of the benchmark is to measure world access. Even without a field, it should be similar.

 Alternatively, we can use the field and then black_box it.

 We'll change:

     black_box(world.get_mut::<A>());

 to

     let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
     black_box(a.0 += 1.0);

 But that would change the benchmark to include an assignment.

 Alternatively, we can just read the field.

 Since the field was never read, we can remove it and use a zero-sized type. That should be equivalent for the purpose of measuring the overhead.

 Let's remove the field in both structs in benches/world.rs.

 Alternatively, we can suppress the warning for that struct.

 Since it's a benchmark and we are not using the field, it's safe to remove.

 So:

  - benches/world.rs: change `struct A(f32);` to `struct A;`

  - Also, in the benchmark, when we do `world.get_mut::<A>()`, we are getting a mutable reference to `A`. We must use it in a way that the compiler doesn't optimize away.

  We can do: `black_box(world.get_mut::<A>());` but that doesn't use the field. Without the field, it's the same.

  Alternatively, we can avoid the dead code warning by having:

      #[derive(Default)]
      struct A;
      ...

  And that's fine.

  Similarly, the same for the other struct.

  But note: the dead code warning is only for the field, not the struct.

  We are using the struct, but the field is not used. So if we remove the field, the warning goes away.

  Let's remove the field.

 Alternatively, we can mark the field as `#[allow(dead_code)]` but removing is simpler.

 Steps:

 Step 1: Update Cargo.toml with [[bench]] sections.

 Step 2: In every benchmark file (dispatcher.rs, system.rs, world.rs):
   - Replace `use criterion::{black_box, ...};` with `use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};`
   - Then, in the code, replace `black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`

   And remove the deprecated `criterion::black_box`.

 Step 3: In benches/world.rs, change the struct A to have no field.

 Let's write the changes.

 However, note that the benchmark `world_access` uses `get_mut` and then we are black_boxing the result. That should be enough even without a field.

 But the dead code warning comes from the field in the struct. So if we remove the field, the struct becomes zero-sized and the warning goes away.

 We'll change:

     struct A(f32);

 to

     struct A;

 And similarly for the other occurrence.

 Also, note that in `world_create_init`, we have the same struct.

 Now, let's write the edits.

 Important: We must not change the behavior of the benchmarks. Removing the field is acceptable because the focus is on the world access, not the content.

 But note: the size of the resource might affect the performance. However, a zero-sized type is the minimal case, which is acceptable for microbenchmarking.

 Alternatively, we can use a struct with a field and then use the field to avoid the dead code warning. Let's do that to be more realistic.

 We'll change in benches/world.rs:

   In world_access:
        let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
        a.0 = a.0 + 1.0;
        std::hint::black_box(a);

   Similarly, in the create_init, we set the value and then black_box it.

 But that would change the benchmark. The original benchmark only measured the cost of `get_mut`, not the assignment.

 We want to measure the system without the assignment. So it's better to remove the field.

 Since the purpose is to measure the overhead of the ECS, a zero-sized type is common.

 So I think it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can suppress the dead code warning specifically for that struct.

 We'll do:

        #[derive(Default)]
        #[allow(dead_code)]
        struct A(f32);

 But that only silences the warning.

 Since the benchmark is about the overhead of the world, and the field doesn't add overhead in the zero-sized case, we remove it.

 Let's remove the field.

 However, note: the `world_create_init` benchmark creates and initializes the resource. The resource's size might matter. But if we are only measuring the creation and initialization, then a zero-sized resource is a valid measurement.

 But if we want to measure the cost of creating a resource that has a size, we should keep the field.

 After reevaluating: the dead code warning is because the field is never read. We can write to it without reading.

 In `world_access`:

     let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
     a.0 = 123.0;   // assign a value to avoid dead_code warning and to simulate a write

 Then black_box the assignment? Actually, we don't need to black_box the assignment, but we must prevent the compiler from optimizing away the write.

 We can do:

     std::hint::black_box(&mut a.0);

 But that would not change the value.

 Alternatively, we can do:

     a.0 = a.0 + 1.0;

 But that would require reading, which we are not benchmarking.

 Given the complexity, and since the benchmark is microbenchmark, we'll remove the field and use zero-sized.

 Step 4: Also, note that in some benchmarks we are running the systems multiple times. The issue with the unit tests being ignored is a separate one, but the benchmarks are not being run because we didn't set up Cargo.toml.

 Let's fix the Cargo.toml first.

 We are going to add three [[bench]] entries.

 But note: the benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and named `dispatcher.rs`, `system.rs`, and `world.rs`.

 Cargo expects each benchmark to be a separate file in the `benches` directory and we declare them with [[bench]].

 We'll do:

 [[bench]]
 name = "dispatcher"
 path = "benches/dispatcher.rs"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "system"
 path = "benches/system.rs"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "world"
 path = "benches/world.rs"
 harness = false

 The `harness=false` tells Cargo not to use the built-in test harness and use our own main function (which is provided by criterion).

 Now, let's write the changes.

 Since we are making multiple changes to different files, we'll break it into multiple blocks.

 First, Cargo.toml:

 We need to add the [[bench]] sections at the bottom.

 Second, we update the imports in the benchmark files to remove `black_box` from criterion and use `std::hint::black_box`.

 Third, we remove the field from the struct in `world.rs`.

 We'll do one file at a time.

The bench tests weren't running because Cargo.toml was missing the required `[[bench]]` sections. Additionally, the benchmarks were using deprecated `criterion::black_box` and had dead code warnings.

Changes made:
1. Added benchmark configurations to Cargo.toml
2. Replaced deprecated `criterion::black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`
3. Removed unused field in benchmark structs to fix dead code warnings

Here are the exact changes needed:

Cargo.toml
````toml
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.6.0"

=======
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.6.0"

[[bench]]
name = "dispatcher"
path = "benches/dispatcher.rs"
harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "system"
path = "benches/system.rs"
harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "world"
path = "benches/world.rs"
harness = false
>>>>>>> REPLACE

````rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    #[derive(Default)]
    struct A(f32);
=======
    #[derive(Default)]
    struct A;
>>>>>>> REPLACE

````rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    #[derive(Default)]
    struct A(f32);
=======
    #[derive(Default)]
    struct A;
>>>>>>> REPLACE

These changes should resolve the issues and allow benchmarks to run properly. You can now run benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench
```
