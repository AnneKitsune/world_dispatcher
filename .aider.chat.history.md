# Coding Style Guide

## General Style
1. Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions and types
2. Prefer explicit code over clever tricks
3. Document public APIs thoroughly with Rustdoc comments
4. Keep line lengths reasonable (typically under 100 chars)
5. Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
6. Place imports at top of file (except test modules)

## Rust Specifics
1. Use derive macros (Default, Debug) where appropriate
2. Implement traits explicitly rather than blanket impls when possible
3. Use Result types for error handling rather than panics
4. Document error conditions clearly in docs
5. Use generics and traits to create flexible APIs
6. Prefer atomic_refcell over Mutex for thread-safe interior mutability

## Documentation Style
1. Include examples in docs showing common usage
2. Document limitations and edge cases
3. Use markdown formatting in docs
4. Include crate-level docs explaining overall purpose
5. Document feature flags and their effects
6. Include maintainer/contact info in README

## Testing Style
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Test edge cases explicitly
3. Include wasm-bindgen-test for WASM compatibility
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Test both success and error paths
6. Benchmark performance-critical code

## Lessons Learned

1. The power of Rust's type system for safe ECS implementation:
   - TypeId for runtime type checking
   - Generics for flexible system functions
   - Traits for clean abstraction boundaries

2. Importance of clear error handling:
   - Distinct error types for different failure modes
   - Macros to simplify error creation
   - Documenting expected error conditions

3. Performance considerations:
   - AtomicRefCell for thread-safe access
   - Careful system staging for parallel execution
   - Benchmarking different approaches

4. API design principles:
   - Builder pattern for complex construction
   - Feature flags for opt-in complexity
   - Clear documentation of requirements/limitations

5. Testing methodology:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for combined behavior
   - WASM compatibility testing
   - Benchmarking performance characteristics

#### Add criterion to Cargo.toml and update the benchmarks to use criterion rather than the unstable built-in benchmark utility. The Latest version of criterion available is 0.6.0.  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

We are going to:
 1. Update Cargo.toml to add criterion under [dev-dependencies] and remove the bench feature since criterion doesn't require it.
 2. Rewrite the benchmark files to use criterion instead of the built-in test::Bencher.

 However, note that the current benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and have the following names:
   - benches/dispatcher.rs
   - benches/world.rs
   - benches/system.rs

 We'll create corresponding criterion benchmarks. Also, we can remove the `#![feature(test)]` and `extern crate test;` since criterion doesn't require them.

 Since the project already has a `benches` directory, we can keep the same structure.

 Steps for each benchmark file:
   - Remove the feature and extern crate test.
   - Remove the use of test::Bencher.
   - Use criterion_group and criterion_main to define the benchmark group.

 But note: The original benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and are built as separate executables.

 We'll update each benchmark file accordingly.

 However, we need to update Cargo.toml to remove the `feature(test)` and add criterion.

 Let's update Cargo.toml first.


</think>

We'll update the benchmarks to use Criterion instead of the built-in test bench. The changes include:

1. Adding the latest Criterion (0.6.0) as a dev dependency
2. Updating each benchmark file to use Criterion's API
3. Removing unstable features like `#![feature(test)]`

Here are the changes:

#### No benches were ran. find the issue and fix it.  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

We are seeing warnings about using the deprecated `criterion::black_box` and dead code in the benchmarks.
 Additionally, the benchmarks are not running because according to the output, the bench tests are being ignored.

 However, the main issue is that the benchmarks are not running. The output says:
   "Running unittests src/lib.rs ... 8 ignored"
   "Running benches/dispatcher.rs ... 0 tests"
   etc.

 This suggests that the benchmark files are not being recognized as benchmarks.

 In Criterion.rs, we use `criterion_main!` and `criterion_group!` to define the benchmarks.
 But note that the benchmark files must have a `main` function that is generated by `criterion_main!`.

 Looking at the files we have:

 benches/dispatcher.rs ends with:
   criterion_group!(benches, build_dispatcher, run_dispatcher);
   criterion_main!(benches);

 This should define a main function. However, the output says "running 0 tests".

 The issue might be that the benchmark files are not being compiled as benchmarks.

 In Cargo.toml, we have:
   [dev-dependencies]
   criterion = "0.6.0"

 But we haven't told Cargo about the benchmark files.

 We need to add a `[[bench]]` section in Cargo.toml for each benchmark.

 Alternatively, we can have one `[[bench]]` and then use multiple criterion groups? Actually, typically we have one benchmark per file and one [[bench]] per file.

 Let's change Cargo.toml to include:

 [[bench]]
 name = "dispatcher"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "system"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "world"
 harness = false

 But note: the current Cargo.toml does not have any `[[bench]]` sections.

 Without this, Cargo doesn't know to run the benches.

 Also, we are getting warnings about dead code and deprecated black_box.

 We should fix the deprecated black_box by replacing it with `std::hint::black_box` as suggested.

 And for the dead code, we can either remove the field or mark it as used. Since it's a benchmark, we can remove the field because it's just for demonstration.

 Let's break down the changes:

 1. Update Cargo.toml to include the benchmark sections.
 2. In each benchmark file, replace `criterion::black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`.
 3. Remove the unused fields in `benches/world.rs` to fix the dead code warning.

 However, note that the dead code warning is for `struct A(f32);` in benches/world.rs. We are using `A` in the benchmarks, but the field `0` is not used. We can change it to `struct A;` or use the field.

 Since the benchmark is about accessing the resource, we can use the field to avoid the dead code warning.

 Let's change in benches/world.rs:

 Instead of:
     struct A(f32);

 We can do:
     struct A(u32);
     ... and in the iteration, set it to some value and then read it.

 But that would change the benchmark. Alternatively, we can just ignore the warning with `#[allow(dead_code)]` or use the field.

 However, the warning suggests removing the field. So we can change to:

     struct A;

 But then we are not storing any data. The purpose of the benchmark is to measure world access. Even without a field, it should be similar.

 Alternatively, we can use the field and then black_box it.

 We'll change:

     black_box(world.get_mut::<A>());

 to

     let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
     black_box(a.0 += 1.0);

 But that would change the benchmark to include an assignment.

 Alternatively, we can just read the field.

 Since the field was never read, we can remove it and use a zero-sized type. That should be equivalent for the purpose of measuring the overhead.

 Let's remove the field in both structs in benches/world.rs.

 Alternatively, we can suppress the warning for that struct.

 Since it's a benchmark and we are not using the field, it's safe to remove.

 So:

  - benches/world.rs: change `struct A(f32);` to `struct A;`

  - Also, in the benchmark, when we do `world.get_mut::<A>()`, we are getting a mutable reference to `A`. We must use it in a way that the compiler doesn't optimize away.

  We can do: `black_box(world.get_mut::<A>());` but that doesn't use the field. Without the field, it's the same.

  Alternatively, we can avoid the dead code warning by having:

      #[derive(Default)]
      struct A;
      ...

  And that's fine.

  Similarly, the same for the other struct.

  But note: the dead code warning is only for the field, not the struct.

  We are using the struct, but the field is not used. So if we remove the field, the warning goes away.

  Let's remove the field.

 Alternatively, we can mark the field as `#[allow(dead_code)]` but removing is simpler.

 Steps:

 Step 1: Update Cargo.toml with [[bench]] sections.

 Step 2: In every benchmark file (dispatcher.rs, system.rs, world.rs):
   - Replace `use criterion::{black_box, ...};` with `use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};`
   - Then, in the code, replace `black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`

   And remove the deprecated `criterion::black_box`.

 Step 3: In benches/world.rs, change the struct A to have no field.

 Let's write the changes.

 However, note that the benchmark `world_access` uses `get_mut` and then we are black_boxing the result. That should be enough even without a field.

 But the dead code warning comes from the field in the struct. So if we remove the field, the struct becomes zero-sized and the warning goes away.

 We'll change:

     struct A(f32);

 to

     struct A;

 And similarly for the other occurrence.

 Also, note that in `world_create_init`, we have the same struct.

 Now, let's write the edits.

 Important: We must not change the behavior of the benchmarks. Removing the field is acceptable because the focus is on the world access, not the content.

 But note: the size of the resource might affect the performance. However, a zero-sized type is the minimal case, which is acceptable for microbenchmarking.

 Alternatively, we can use a struct with a field and then use the field to avoid the dead code warning. Let's do that to be more realistic.

 We'll change in benches/world.rs:

   In world_access:
        let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
        a.0 = a.0 + 1.0;
        std::hint::black_box(a);

   Similarly, in the create_init, we set the value and then black_box it.

 But that would change the benchmark. The original benchmark only measured the cost of `get_mut`, not the assignment.

 We want to measure the system without the assignment. So it's better to remove the field.

 Since the purpose is to measure the overhead of the ECS, a zero-sized type is common.

 So I think it's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can suppress the dead code warning specifically for that struct.

 We'll do:

        #[derive(Default)]
        #[allow(dead_code)]
        struct A(f32);

 But that only silences the warning.

 Since the benchmark is about the overhead of the world, and the field doesn't add overhead in the zero-sized case, we remove it.

 Let's remove the field.

 However, note: the `world_create_init` benchmark creates and initializes the resource. The resource's size might matter. But if we are only measuring the creation and initialization, then a zero-sized resource is a valid measurement.

 But if we want to measure the cost of creating a resource that has a size, we should keep the field.

 After reevaluating: the dead code warning is because the field is never read. We can write to it without reading.

 In `world_access`:

     let mut a = world.get_mut::<A>();
     a.0 = 123.0;   // assign a value to avoid dead_code warning and to simulate a write

 Then black_box the assignment? Actually, we don't need to black_box the assignment, but we must prevent the compiler from optimizing away the write.

 We can do:

     std::hint::black_box(&mut a.0);

 But that would not change the value.

 Alternatively, we can do:

     a.0 = a.0 + 1.0;

 But that would require reading, which we are not benchmarking.

 Given the complexity, and since the benchmark is microbenchmark, we'll remove the field and use zero-sized.

 Step 4: Also, note that in some benchmarks we are running the systems multiple times. The issue with the unit tests being ignored is a separate one, but the benchmarks are not being run because we didn't set up Cargo.toml.

 Let's fix the Cargo.toml first.

 We are going to add three [[bench]] entries.

 But note: the benchmark files are in the `benches` directory and named `dispatcher.rs`, `system.rs`, and `world.rs`.

 Cargo expects each benchmark to be a separate file in the `benches` directory and we declare them with [[bench]].

 We'll do:

 [[bench]]
 name = "dispatcher"
 path = "benches/dispatcher.rs"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "system"
 path = "benches/system.rs"
 harness = false

 [[bench]]
 name = "world"
 path = "benches/world.rs"
 harness = false

 The `harness=false` tells Cargo not to use the built-in test harness and use our own main function (which is provided by criterion).

 Now, let's write the changes.

 Since we are making multiple changes to different files, we'll break it into multiple blocks.

 First, Cargo.toml:

 We need to add the [[bench]] sections at the bottom.

 Second, we update the imports in the benchmark files to remove `black_box` from criterion and use `std::hint::black_box`.

 Third, we remove the field from the struct in `world.rs`.

 We'll do one file at a time.


</think>

The bench tests weren't running because Cargo.toml was missing the required `[[bench]]` sections. Additionally, the benchmarks were using deprecated `criterion::black_box` and had dead code warnings.

Changes made:
1. Added benchmark configurations to Cargo.toml
2. Replaced deprecated `criterion::black_box` with `std::hint::black_box`
3. Removed unused field in benchmark structs to fix dead code warnings

Here are the exact changes needed:

These changes should resolve the issues and allow benchmarks to run properly. You can now run benchmarks with:

We are going to create a new file `ai.md` with the documentation of the public API of the crate.
 The crate name and version are taken from Cargo.toml: name = "world_dispatcher", version = "2.1.0"

 We will go through every public item in the following files:
   src/lib.rs (which includes the crate-level documentation and re-exports)
   src/dispatcher.rs
   src/resource.rs
   src/system.rs
   src/world.rs

 Note: The module `typeid` is private (pub(crate)) and not exported, so we skip it.

 Steps:
 1. Start with the crate name and version.
 2. Include the crate-level documentation (from lib.rs) as a description of the crate.
 3. Then, for each module (which are public and re-exported in lib.rs) we list the public items.

 We'll break down by module:

 - The root module (from lib.rs) has:
     pub use self::dispatcher::*;
     pub use self::resource::*;
     pub use self::system::*;
     pub use self::world::*;

   So we'll have sections for:
     - `dispatcher`: DispatcherBuilder, Dispatcher
     - `resource`: Resource trait, RefLifetime trait (but note: RefLifetime is pub(crate) so not public? Let me double-check)

   Actually, in `src/resource.rs`:
        pub(crate) trait RefLifetime {}
   So it's not public. Only `Resource` is public.

 - `system`: System struct, IntoSystem trait

 - `world`: World struct

 Also note: The crate-level documentation in lib.rs.

 Important: We are only including public items (with `pub`). We are not including private items.

 We are going to write the documentation in the `ai.md` file.

 Format:

 # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

 ## Description of the crate
 [The crate-level doc string from lib.rs]

 Then, for each module (dispatcher, resource, system, world) we have a section.

 Since these modules are re-exported in the root, we can document them as if they are top-level.

 However, note that in the lib.rs we have:
        pub use self::dispatcher::*;
        pub use self::resource::*;
        pub use self::system::*;
        pub use self::world::*;

 So we don't have nested modules in the public API. We'll just put everything at the top level.

 We'll structure:

 ### Struct `DispatcherBuilder`
 [Documentation]

 ### Struct `Dispatcher`
 [Documentation]

 ... and so on.

 But note: the original module structure is not preserved in the root. So we just list all public items by kind (struct, trait, function) in the root.

 However, the example provided by the user uses the module structure. Since our public API is flattened, what to do?

 The example had:

   ### Module `root`
   ... (and then inside the root module, the items)

   ### Module `prelude`

 Since in our case, we have a flat public API (because we re-export everything in the root), we can just have:

   ### Root Module

   [List of items]

 But note: the example also included the module for `prelude` which was a submodule.

 We don't have any public submodule, so we just have one top-level module.

 However, to be consistent with the example, we can call the root module `root`.

 Alternatively, the example seems to group by the original module. But our public API doesn't have modules.

 Let me check: if we look at the generated documentation for the crate, it will have a root module and then the re-exports.

 Since we are writing for an AI, and the user's example grouped by the module, we might try to group by the original source module even though they are re-exported? 

 But the user's requirement: "For every single public struct, trait and function"

 And the example output grouped by the module where they are defined.

 How about we do:

   ### Module `dispatcher`
   [items from dispatcher.rs]

   ### Module `resource`
   [items from resource.rs]

   ... etc.

 Even though these modules are not public, the items are re-exported. But the user might want to know the original module.

 Since the user's example included a `prelude` module, and we don't have that, we can do:

   ### Module `dispatcher` (dispatcher.rs)

   Then list the public items from dispatcher.rs.

 But note: the modules are not public. So the user might be confused.

 Alternatively, we can just put everything in the root module.

 Given the requirement: "For every single public struct, trait and function", and the fact that they are all in the root, we can do:

   ### Root Module

   Then list all public items.

 We'll do:

   # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

   ## Description of the crate
   [crate-level doc from lib.rs]

   ### Root Module

   [Then list of all public items]

 But then we lose the grouping by source file.

 Alternatively, we can note the source file in a comment? 

 Since the example output used the module structure, and we don't have multiple public modules, I think it's safe to put everything under one module.

 After reading the example again: the example had a module `root` and then a module `prelude`. We don't have a prelude. So we just have `root`.

 Let's do:

   # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

   ## Description of the crate
   Notes about resources:
   - Resources MUST implement default
   - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
   - Resources MUST be 'static

   ### Module `root`

   Then we list the public items.

 But the public items are defined in different source files, but they are all in the root module.

 So we list:

   pub struct DispatcherBuilder;
   pub struct Dispatcher;
   pub trait Resource;
   pub struct System;
   pub trait IntoSystem<R>;
   pub struct World;

 Now, we must include the documentation comments for each.

 Steps:
   - For each struct, we list the public methods and associated functions (that are public) and their doc comments.
   - For traits, we list the method signatures and their doc comments.
   - For methods, we only write the signature and omit the body.

 How about the doc comments? We must copy them exactly.

 Example for DispatcherBuilder:

   pub struct DispatcherBuilder {
       /// The current systems in this builder. Hidden from docs to encourage using
       /// the API of the builder, but public to enable extension of the builder.
       pub systems: Vec<System>,
   }
   impl DispatcherBuilder {
       /// Creates a new `DispatcherBuilder`.
       pub fn new() -> Self;
       /// Adds a function implementing `IntoSystem` to the system pool.
       pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(mut self, into_system: F) -> Self;
       /// Adds a `System` to the system pool.
       pub fn add_system(mut self, system: System) -> Self;
       /// Builds a `Dispatcher` from the accumulated set of `System`.
       /// This preserves the order from the inserted systems.
       pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
   }

 But note: the `systems` field is public? Yes, and its documentation says `#[doc(hidden)]` but also has a doc comment. In the rendered docs it's hidden, but we are writing a text file for an AI. We should include it.

 The example output included the struct fields.

 So we do the same.

 Now, let's collect for every public item.

 We are going to process the following files and their public items:

   src/dispatcher.rs:
        pub struct DispatcherBuilder
        pub struct Dispatcher

   src/resource.rs:
        pub trait Resource

   src/system.rs:
        pub struct System
        pub trait IntoSystem<R>

   src/world.rs:
        pub struct World

 Also, note that in `src/system.rs` there is a public module? No, only the items.

 We are going to write the entire documentation in `ai.md`.

 Since the file is empty, we can just write the entire content.

 But note: we have to write exactly as the user's example.

 We'll start:

   # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

   ## Description of the crate
   [The crate-level doc from lib.rs]

   ### Module `root`

   Then we list the items.

 We write the crate-level doc from lib.rs:

   //! Notes about resources:
   //! - Resources MUST implement default
   //! - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
   //! - Resources MUST be 'static

 Then we list the items.

 We'll group by type (struct, trait) and within the same type, by the order they appear in the source.

 Let's start with the structs:

   pub struct DispatcherBuilder {
       /// The current systems in this builder. Hidden from docs to encourage using
       /// the API of the builder, but public to enable extension of the builder.
       pub systems: Vec<System>,
   }

   impl DispatcherBuilder {
       /// Creates a new `DispatcherBuilder`.
       pub fn new() -> Self;
       /// Adds a function implementing `IntoSystem` to the system pool.
       pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(mut self, into_system: F) -> Self;
       /// Adds a `System` to the system pool.
       pub fn add_system(mut self, system: System) -> Self;
       /// Builds a `Dispatcher` from the accumulated set of `System`.
       /// This preserves the order from the inserted systems.
       pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
   }

   pub struct Dispatcher {
       stages: Vec<Vec<System>>,
   }

   impl Dispatcher {
       /// Returns an iterator of all stages. This is not needed for regular use,
       /// but can be useful for debugging or for implementing custom executors.
       pub fn iter_stages(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Vec<System>>;
       /// Runs the systems one after the other, one at a time.
       pub fn run_seq(&mut self, world: &World);
       /// Runs the systems in parallel. Systems having conflicts in their
       /// dependencies (the resource reference they use are the same and at least
       /// one is mutable) are run sequentially relative to each other, while
       /// systems without conflict run in parallel.
       #[cfg(feature = "parallel")]
       pub fn run_par(&mut self, world: &World);
   }

   pub struct System {
       // Note: the fields are not public, but we have public methods.
   }

   impl System {
       /// Initializes the resources required to run this system inside of the
       /// provided `World`, if those resources don't already exist.
       ///
       /// This is called automatically if you use a `Dispatcher`, so in most
       /// cases it is not required to call it manually.
       pub fn initialize(&self, world: &mut World);
       /// Runs the system's function using the provided `World`'s resources.
       pub fn run(&mut self, world: &World);
       /// Returns the underlying type name of the system. This is not guranteed to
       /// be stable or human-readable, but can be used for diagnostics.
       pub fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
   }

   pub struct World {
       // The field is pub(crate) so we don't show it.
   }

   impl World {
       /// Initializes a resource to its default value.
       /// This is the only way to "insert" a resource.
       ///
       /// It is suggested to use a macro to collect all
       /// the resources and initialize all of them.
       pub fn initialize<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self);
       /// Get an immutable reference to a resource by type.
       /// Will return an error if the type is:
       /// - Non initialized
       /// - Already borrowed mutably
       pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;
       // Note: There is also a try_get, but it's pub(crate) so not public.

       /// Get a mutable reference to a resource by type.
       /// Will return an error if the type is:
       /// - Non initialized
       /// - Already borrowed immutably
       /// - Already borrowed mutably
       pub fn get_mut<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
       // Similarly, try_get_mut is pub(crate)

       /// Get a mutable reference to a resource by type, default-initializing it if not already
       /// initialized.
       pub fn get_mut_or_default<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;

       /// Get a mutable reference to a resource by its type id. Useful if using
       /// dynamic dispatching.
       /// Will return an error if the type is:
       /// - Non initialized
       /// - Already borrowed immutably
       /// - Already borrowed mutably
       #[doc(hidden)]
       pub fn get_by_typeid(&self, typeid: &TypeId) -> AtomicRefMut<Box<dyn Resource>>;
   }

   pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}

   pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
       fn system(self) -> System;
   }

 We note that the trait `IntoSystem` has an associated function `system` that is public.

 Also, note that the trait `Resource` is public.

 We are almost done.

 We have to write the entire `ai.md` file.

 Important: The example included the module name and the items in a code block.

 So:

   # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

   ## Description of the crate
   [The crate-level doc from lib.rs]

   ### Module `root`

   ```
   [All the items in the root module, with their full signatures and doc comments, but without the implementations (bodies)]
   ```

 But note: we must format the code block exactly as the example.

 We are going to write the entire content of `ai.md` in one *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

 Since the file is currently empty, the SEARCH section will be empty.

 But we are going to replace an empty string with the entire documentation.

 However, the user's example had multiple code blocks for each module? No, the example had one code block per module section.

 But in our case, we have one module (root).

 So:

   ai.md

 We write it as:

   ## Description of the crate
   Notes about resources:
   - Resources MUST implement default
   - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
   - Resources MUST be 'static

 Also, we are using the crate name and version from Cargo.toml: "world_dispatcher", version "2.1.0".

 We write the header:

   # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

 Important: We are omitting the private methods and fields. For example, in `Dispatcher` we omit the `stages` field because it's not public.

 But in `DispatcherBuilder`, the `systems` field is public so we include it.

 Let me check: for `Dispatcher`, the `stages` field is private? Yes, because there's no `pub` keyword.

 Similarly, for `System`, the fields are private.

 So we don't show private fields.

 However, the example output included the struct fields for `A` even though one of them was private? Actually, the example had:

   pub struct A<T> {
       /// Member b
       pub b: i32,
       /// Inner member
       inner: T,
   }

 We included both the public and private fields. But we mark the private ones as non-public? Actually, we just wrote the struct as it is.

 But we are only documenting the public API? The requirement says "public struct", so we should include the entire struct definition? But then we see the private fields.

 How did the example do? The example included the private field `inner`.

 So we do the same? Because it's the struct definition. The struct is public, so we show all its fields.

 But in our code, we have:

   pub struct Dispatcher {
       stages: Vec<Vec<System>>,
   }

   pub struct System {
       ... (private fields)
   }

   pub struct World {
       pub(crate) res: ...,
   }

 We should include the fields even if they are private? 

 The requirement says: "For every single public struct, trait and function"

 It doesn't say to include private members? But the example did. And the example output included a private field.

 So to match the example, we will show the entire struct definition including private fields.

 Let me adjust:

   For `Dispatcher`:

        pub struct Dispatcher {
            stages: Vec<Vec<System>>,
        }

   For `System`:

        pub struct System {
            pub(crate) initialize: Box<dyn Fn(&mut World) + Send>,
            pub(crate) lock: Box<dyn Fn(*const World, *mut Vec<Box<dyn RefLifetime>>) -> bool + Send>,
            pub(crate) run_fn: Box<dyn FnMut(&World) + Send>,
            pub(crate) name: &'static str,
        }

   But note: the private fields are not part of the public API. So we can omit them? Or include them because they are part of the struct?

   The example included the private field. So we will include them.

   But wait: the `pub(crate)` fields are also not public to the user of the crate. They are public only within the crate.

   We are writing for the public API. The public API should not rely on these fields.

   However, the example output included a private field without any marking. So we do the same.

   Actually, the example output included:

        pub struct A<T> {

We are going to create a new file `ai.md` that contains the documentation for the public API of the crate.
 The crate name and version come from Cargo.toml: "world_dispatcher" version "2.1.0".
 We need to go through every public module and public item.

 Steps:
 1. Start with the crate-level documentation (from lib.rs)
 2. Then, we'll go through each module and public item.

 Important: Only include public items (pub, pub struct, pub trait, pub fn, etc). Do not include private or pub(crate) items.

 We'll break the documentation into sections by module. The root module will be called "root".

 The modules we have that are public (based on lib.rs and the use statements) are:
   - dispatcher (from dispatcher.rs)
   - resource (from resource.rs)
   - system (from system.rs)
   - world (from world.rs)

 But note: In the root module (lib.rs) we also have some public items (like the re-exports of the modules and perhaps other things?).

 However, looking at the files:

   lib.rs: 
     pub use self::dispatcher::*;
     pub use self::resource::*;
     pub use self::system::*;
     pub use self::world::*;

   So the public API is the contents of these modules and also the root module (which re-exports the modules). 

   But for documentation, we will document the modules as separate sections.

   Also note that the root module (lib.rs) has its own crate-level doc string.

  Approach:

   We'll create the `ai.md` file and structure it as:

      # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

      ## Crate-level documentation
      [The crate-level documentation from lib.rs]

      Then, for each module:
        ### Module `dispatcher`
        ```
        [public items from dispatcher.rs]
        ```

        Similarly for `resource`, `system`, `world`.

   But note: the root module also re-exports items from the modules. However, we are documenting the modules separately.

   We do not have any public items in the root module (lib.rs) beyond the re-exports, so we don't need a "root" module section.

   However, note that the crate-level documentation is at the top of lib.rs.

  Details for each file:

   dispatcher.rs:
     Public items: 
        pub struct DispatcherBuilder
        pub struct Dispatcher
        impl DispatcherBuilder
        impl Dispatcher

     Also, the module itself has a doc comment? Only the structs and impls have doc comments.

   resource.rs:
        pub trait Resource -> but note: it's marked as #[doc(hidden)] so perhaps we should not include?
        Also, there's a pub(crate) trait RefLifetime -> not public, so skip.

        Actually, the Resource trait is public? But it's doc(hidden). We are instructed to include public items. Even if hidden? 
        The requirement says: "For every single public struct, trait and function", but hidden ones are still public? 
        We'll follow: include everything that is `pub` regardless of `#[doc(hidden)]`? 

        The instructions say: "Only include things that are public and will visible from users of the crate." 
        But `#[doc(hidden)]` means it's hidden from documentation. However, it's still in the public API. 

        We are writing an internal documentation for the crate, so I think we should include it.

        But note: the example did not include the `inner: T` field because it was private. So we only include public parts.

        In the example, the struct A had a private field and we did not include it.

        So for Resource: it's a public trait, so we include it. But the trait itself is not very useful because it's implemented for all T: Send+Sync+'static.

        Also, there is: 
            impl<T> Resource for T where T: Send + Sync + 'static

        We should document the trait and the blanket impl? But the example included a trait and then the impl was not included. 

        The example only included the trait and the struct and the function signatures. The impl block for A<T> was included because it was public and had a public method.

        We'll include the trait and its methods? But the trait has no methods. Only the blanket impl.

        We'll write:

        pub trait Resource;

   system.rs:
        pub struct System
        impl System (with public methods)

        pub trait IntoSystem<R>
        impl ... for F

        Also, the macro calls (impl_system, etc) are private.

   world.rs:
        pub struct World
        impl World

  But note: the crate-level doc comment in lib.rs is: 
      //! Notes about resources:
      //! - Resources MUST implement default
      //! - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
      //! - Resources MUST be 'static

  We'll put that as the crate-level documentation.

  Format for each item:

    We are to write the signature and the doc comments.

    For a struct: 
        #[derive(...)] if present, and the public fields (if any) and the public methods in the impl block.

    But note: the methods in the impl block are part of the struct. We should include the impl block and the methods.

    However, in the example they did:

        pub struct A<T> {
            /// Member b
            pub b: i32,
        }
        impl<T: Default> A<A> {
            /// Creates a new A
            pub const fn new() -> Self;
        }

    But note: the inner field was private and omitted.

  Guidelines for signature:

    We omit the body of functions and methods, and just put a semicolon.

  How to handle methods? We should include the entire impl block if it's public? But note that the methods are in the impl block.

    Actually, we should list the impl block for the public methods of the struct.

    But note: the impl block might have private methods? We only include public methods.

    We'll write the impl block with the public methods (with their signatures and doc comments).

  But note: the example included the impl block for `A<A>`, which is a specific instantiation. We have to be careful.

  Actually, in the example the impl block was: `impl<T: Default> A<A> { ... }` -> that seems like a typo? Probably meant `A<T>`. 

  We'll stick to the example: only include the public methods.

  We'll use the format:

        #[derive(...)]   // if present
        pub struct Name ...   // without private fields

        impl Name {
            // public methods (without the body, just the signature)
        }

  For traits:

        pub trait TraitName {
            // methods (with their doc comments) without implementation
        }

  For functions:

        /// Doc comment
        pub fn function_name(...) -> ...;

  But note: some of the methods are defined in a macro, so they don't appear in the source. We have to write what the user sees.

  Specifically, in system.rs, the IntoSystem trait is implemented for functions with different numbers of arguments, via a macro.

  We cannot expand the macro, but note that the macro generates many impl blocks. However, the trait itself is public.

  We'll write the trait and then note that it's implemented for functions with up to N arguments? But we don't write the impls.

  But the example included a trait and then the function signature for the trait method.

  So we write:

        pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
            fn system(self) -> System;
        }

  And the macro-generated impls are not written.

  Similarly, for the DispatcherBuilder and Dispatcher, we write the struct and their impl blocks.

  Now, we write the content for each module.

  We are going to create the ai.md file.

  Let's start:

  File: ai.md

  Note: We are only writing the public API. We skip private items.

  We'll go file by file.

  First, the root module (lib.rs) crate-level doc.

  Then:

    Module: dispatcher (from src/dispatcher.rs)
    Module: resource (from src/resource.rs)
    Module: system (from src/system.rs)
    Module: world (from src/world.rs)

  We do not have any other public modules.

  Now, we collect the public items from each of these files.

  dispatcher.rs:

      /// A builder that accumulates systems to be inserted into a `Dispatcher`.
      #[derive(Default)]
      pub struct DispatcherBuilder { ... }   -> but note: the `systems` field is public? 
          Actually, the field is marked as `#[doc(hidden)]` but public. We omit the fields? 

          The example omitted the private field. But the example struct had a public field and a private one.

          In this case, the `DispatcherBuilder` has:

              pub systems: Vec<System>

          So we include the public field.

          So we write:

          #[derive(Default)]
          pub struct DispatcherBuilder {
              #[doc(hidden)]
              /// ... but we include the field because it's public? 
              /// The instructions: include every public item. The field is public.

              However, note the example: the struct A had a public field and we included it.

          So:

          pub struct DispatcherBuilder {
              /// (the doc comment for the field, if any)
          }

          But the field does have a doc comment? Yes: 

          /// The current systems in this builder. Hidden from docs to encourage using
          /// the API of the builder, but public to enable extension of the builder.

          So we include the field and its doc.

      Then the impl block for DispatcherBuilder:

          impl DispatcherBuilder {
              pub fn new() -> Self;
              pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(mut self, into_system: F) -> Self;
              pub fn add_system(mut self, system: System) -> Self;
              pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
          }

      Then the struct Dispatcher:

          /// A dispatcher is used to execute a collection of `System` in order and
          /// possibly in parallel using `World`'s resources.
          pub struct Dispatcher { ... }   -> private field: stages.

          Then the impl block:

          impl Dispatcher {
              pub fn iter_stages(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Vec<System>>;
              pub fn run_seq(&mut self, world: &World);
              #[cfg(feature = "parallel")]
              pub fn run_par(&mut self, world: &World);
          }

      But note: the `run_par` is conditional. We should mark it with the cfg.

  resource.rs:

      /// The type of `Resource`s.
      #[doc(hidden)]
      pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}

      Then the blanket impl:

          impl<T> Resource for T where T: Send + Sync + 'static {}

      We don't include the blanket impl? Since the example only included the trait.

      Also, we have the downcast! macro expansion? We don't include that.

  system.rs:

      pub struct System {
          // fields are private? They are not marked pub. So we don't include.
      }

      Then an impl block:

          impl System {
              pub fn initialize(&self, world: &mut World);
              pub fn run(&mut self, world: &World);
              pub fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
          }

      Then the trait:

          pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
              fn system(self) -> System;
          }

      Then the macro-generated impls. We don't include them.

  world.rs:

      pub struct World {
          // private field: we skip
      }

      impl World {
          pub fn initialize<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self);
          pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;
          pub fn try_get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> Result<AtomicRef<T>, ()>;   -> but wait, try_get is pub(crate)!

          So only:

          pub fn initialize<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self);
          pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;
          pub fn get_mut<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
          pub fn try_get_mut<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> Result<AtomicRefMut<T>, ()>;   -> wait, this is pub(crate) too?

          Actually, from the code:

              pub fn try_get<T: ...>(...) -> ...;   -> is marked pub(crate)
              pub fn try_get_mut<T: ...>(...) -> ...;   -> pub(crate)

          The public methods are:

              initialize
              get
              get_mut
              get_mut_or_default
              get_by_typeid   -> marked as `#[doc(hidden)]` but public. We include.

          Also:

              pub fn get_mut_or_default<T: ...>(&mut self) -> ...;

          And:

              pub fn get_by_typeid(&self, typeid: &TypeId) -> ...;

      So we include:

          pub struct World;

          impl World {
              pub fn initialize<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self);
              pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;
              pub fn get_mut<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
              pub fn get_mut_or_default<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
              #[doc(hidden)]
              pub fn get_by_typeid(&self, typeid: &TypeId) -> AtomicRefMut<Box<dyn Resource>>;
          }

  Now, let's write the ai.md file.

  Note: For types that are not defined in the crate but used, we don't expand them (like AtomicRef, AtomicRefMut). They come from `atomic_refcell_try`.

  We write:

      # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

      ## Crate-level documentation
      Notes about resources:
      - Resources MUST implement default
      - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
      - Resources MUST be 'static

      ### Module `dispatcher`

      ... items from dispatcher.rs

      Similarly for others.

  We'll write the content in a code block for each module.

  The file ai.md is currently empty. We are going to create it.

  We'll do it in one go since it's a new file.

  Note: We must be cautious with the exact signatures (including cfg, derives, and doc comments).

  Let's write the content for ai.md.


</think>

I'll go through all the public structs, traits, and functions in the codebase and document them in ai.md. I'll structure it with crate-level documentation first, followed by each module with its public items. For each item, I'll include signatures and doc comments while excluding private implementation details.

Here's the content for ai.md:

ai.md
````markdown
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
# AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0.

## Crate-level documentation
Provides the System part of a full ECS, along with a fast dispatcher and world container.

Notes about resources:
- Resources MUST implement default
- Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
- Resources MUST be 'static

### Module `dispatcher`

```
/// A builder that accumulates systems to be inserted into a `Dispatcher`.
///
/// For more complex workflows, this builder can have new traits implemented for
/// it, using the public `systems` member.
#[derive(Default)]

    pub systems: Vec<System>,
}

impl DispatcherBuilder {
    /// Creates a new `DispatcherBuilder`.
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    
    /// Adds a function implementing `IntoSystem` to the system pool.
    pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(mut self, into_system: F) -> Self;
    
    /// Adds a `System` to the system pool.
    pub fn add_system(mut self, system: System) -> Self;

    /// This preserves the order from the inserted systems.
    pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
}

/// A dispatcher is used to execute a collection of `System` in order and
/// possibly in parallel using `World`'s resources.

pub struct Dispatcher;

impl Dispatcher {
    /// Returns an iterator of all stages. This is not needed for regular use,
    /// but can be useful for debugging or for implementing custom executors.
    pub fn iter_stages(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Vec<System>>;
    
    /// Runs the systems one after the other, one at a time.
    pub fn run_seq(&mut self, world: &World);
    
    /// Runs the systems in parallel. Systems having conflicts in their

    /// one is mutable) are run sequentially relative to each other, while
    /// systems without conflict run in parallel.
    #[cfg(feature = "parallel")]
    pub fn run_par(&mut self, world: &World);
}
```

### Module `resource`

```
/// The type of `Resource`s.
/// All types having a 'static lifetime automatically implement this.
#[doc(hidden)]
pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}
```

### Module `system`

```
/// Struct used to run a system function using the world.
/// This struct is also used internally by the `Dispatcher` to create a coherent
/// execution sequence.
pub struct System;

impl System {
    /// Initializes the resources required to run this system inside of the
    /// provided `World`, if those resources don't already exist.
    ///
    /// This is called automatically if you use a `Dispatcher`, so in most
    /// cases it is not required to call it manually.

We are going to create a file `ai.md` that contains the documentation for the public API of the crate.
 Steps:
 1. Extract the crate name and version from Cargo.toml: "world_dispatcher" and "2.1.0".
 2. Include the crate-level documentation from lib.rs (the "//! Notes about resources" comment).
 3. Go through each file that contains public items (lib.rs, dispatcher.rs, resource.rs, world.rs, system.rs) and document every public struct, trait, function, and method.
    - We note that the crate re-exports items from modules: `dispatcher`, `resource`, `system`, `world`.
    - We organize by the module as seen by the user. Since the crate re-exports many items at the root, we will consider the root module and the modules that are not re-exported (if any) separately.
    - For each public item, we write the signature and doc comments. We remove empty lines and empty comment lines without text.
    - We include `#[derive(...)]` and `#[cfg(...)]` attributes but not `#[allow(...)]`.

 Important: 
   - We must not include private or pub(crate) items.
   - We consider the re-exports: the root module (lib.rs) re-exports `DispatcherBuilder`, `Dispatcher`, `Resource` (trait), `RefLifetime` (trait? but note: it is pub(crate) so we skip), `System`, `IntoSystem`, `World`.
   - But note: the trait `RefLifetime` is marked as `pub(crate)`, so it is not public and should be excluded.

 How we organize:
   We'll have a section for the crate and a section for each module that has public items. Since the re-exports are at the root, we document the following:

   - The root module (which in Rust is the crate root) will contain:
        * The crate-level doc comment (from lib.rs)
        * The structs, enums, traits, functions that are re-exported at the root.

   However, note that the modules themselves (like `dispatcher`, `world`, etc.) are not public. The user sees everything at the root.

   But wait: in lib.rs we have:
        pub use self::dispatcher::*;
        pub use self::resource::*;
        pub use self::system::*;
        pub use self::world::*;

   So all public items from these modules are available at the root.

   Therefore, we will have:

      # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0

      ## Description of the crate
      [The crate-level documentation from lib.rs]

      ### Module `root`
      [All the public items from the root, which are the re-exported items from the modules]

   But note: the module `resource` has a public trait `Resource` and also a public trait `RefLifetime`? Actually, `RefLifetime` is `pub(crate)`. So we don't include it.

   We need to go through each file:

   File: lib.rs
      - The crate doc: "//! Notes about resources: ..."
      - The re-exports: so we don't document the modules, but the items that are re-exported.

   File: dispatcher.rs
      Public items:
        - DispatcherBuilder (struct)
        - Dispatcher (struct)

   File: resource.rs
      Public items:
        - Resource (trait)

   File: world.rs
      Public items:
        - World (struct)

   File: system.rs
      Public items:
        - System (struct)
        - IntoSystem (trait)

   Also, note that the methods of these structs and traits are public.

   Approach for each item:

     For a struct:
        We write the struct definition with its public fields (if any) and the `impl` blocks that contain public methods (we don't include private methods). We also include the doc comments.

     For a trait:
        We write the trait definition and its methods.

     We must not include private methods or private fields.

   Example for `DispatcherBuilder`:

     In dispatcher.rs:
        pub struct DispatcherBuilder { ... }  // but note: the field `systems` has `#[doc(hidden)]` so we don't include it? 
        However, the rule is: "Do not include pub(crate) or private internals." and the field is public? Actually, the field is public but hidden. But the user can see it. The instruction says: only include things that are public and visible. Since the field is public, we should include it? But the instruction also says: include the signature and doc comments. However, the field has `#[doc(hidden)]` so it is not meant to be part of the public API. We should skip it.

     But note: the struct definition only has one field: `systems` and it is marked `#[doc(hidden)]` and the comment says it's public only to allow extending the builder. However, the user is not supposed to use it. Since the documentation says it's hidden, we should not include it.

     So for `DispatcherBuilder` we write:

        pub struct DispatcherBuilder;

        impl DispatcherBuilder {
            pub fn new() -> Self;
            pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(self, into_system: F) -> Self;
            pub fn add_system(self, system: System) -> Self;
            pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
        }

     We skip the field entirely.

   Similarly, for `System` in system.rs, it has several public methods and a public field `name`? Actually, the `name` field is public? It's marked `pub(crate)`? No, it's `pub name: &'static str`? But wait: 

        pub struct System {
            pub(crate) initialize: ...,
            pub(crate) lock: ...,
            pub(crate) run_fn: ...,
            pub name: &'static str,
        }

     The first three fields are pub(crate) so we skip them. But the `name` field is public. However, it has no doc comment? But we should include it because it's public. But note: the `System` struct is public and the field is public. However, the instruction says: include every public struct and function. So we must include the field.

     But wait, the instruction says: "For every single public struct, trait and function, write down the signature and doc comments". The struct `System` has a public field `name` without a doc comment. We write it as:

        pub struct System {
            pub name: &'static str,
        }

     However, we also note that there are methods:

        pub fn initialize(&self, world: &mut World);
        pub fn run(&mut self, world: &World);
        pub fn name(&self) -> &'static str;

     But the last method `name` is redundant with the field. However, it's part of the API.

     We must be cautious: the struct has more fields but they are not public, so we don't include them.

   However, this might be confusing because the user cannot construct a `System` without the hidden fields. But that's okay because we are documenting the public interface.

   Alternatively, we note that the `System` struct is opaque? The user gets it from `IntoSystem` and uses it via the methods. The field `name` is just for diagnostics. We include it.

   We will follow this pattern.

   Now, let's collect:

   Crate: world_dispatcher v2.1.0

   Root module (as seen by the user) - the re-exports:

   From dispatcher.rs:

      pub struct DispatcherBuilder;
      impl DispatcherBuilder {
          pub fn new() -> Self;
          pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(self, into_system: F) -> Self;
          pub fn add_system(self, system: System) -> Self;
          pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
      }

      pub struct Dispatcher;
      impl Dispatcher {
          pub fn iter_stages(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Vec<System>>;
          pub fn run_seq(&mut self, world: &World);
          #[cfg(feature = "parallel")]
          pub fn run_par(&mut self, world: &World);
      }

   From resource.rs:

      pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}
      // Note: the doc comment: "The type of `Resource`s. ..."

   From world.rs:

      pub struct World;
      impl World {
          pub fn initialize<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self);
          pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;
          pub fn get_mut<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
          pub fn get_mut_or_default<T: Default + Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self) -> AtomicRefMut<T>;
          pub fn get_by_typeid(&self, typeid: &TypeId) -> AtomicRefMut<Box<dyn Resource>>;  // note: this is marked as #[doc(hidden)], so do we include? The instruction says: only public and visible. The doc hidden means it's not intended for public use, but it's still public. We have to include it? The instruction does not say to skip doc(hidden) items. We include it but note the doc comment says it's hidden.

          // But note: there is also `try_get` and `try_get_mut` but they are pub(crate) -> skip.
      }

   From system.rs:

      pub struct System {
          pub name: &'static str,
      }
      impl System {
          pub fn initialize(&self, world: &mut World);
          pub fn run(&mut self, world: &World);
          pub fn name(&self) -> &'static str;   // redundant? but we include.
      }

      pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
          fn system(self) -> System;
      }

   We must also note that lib.rs has a crate doc.

   Now, we write into `ai.md`.

   Format:

      # AI Documentation for world_dispatcher v2.1.0

      ## Description of the crate

      Notes about resources:
      - Resources MUST implement default
      - Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
      - Resources MUST be 'static

      ### Module `root`

      ... all the items ...

   We don't have any submodule that is public and re-exported, so we only have the root module.

   We write the items in the order we found them? Or group by kind? The example grouped by the item kind (struct, trait, function). We can follow the example: structs, traits, functions.

   Alternatively, we can write the items as they appear in the files, but that might be messy. The example just listed them in the order they appear in the example code.

   We'll try to group by type: first the structs (with their impls), then the traits, then the functions (if any).

   But note: the example included the impl block for the struct in the same struct's section.

   We do:

      #[derive(Default)]
      pub struct DispatcherBuilder;
      impl DispatcherBuilder {
          // methods
      }

      pub struct Dispatcher;
      impl Dispatcher {
          // methods
      }

      pub struct World;
      impl World {
          // methods
      }

      pub struct System {
          pub name: &'static str,
      }
      impl System {
          // methods
      }

      pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}
      pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
          fn system(self) -> System;
      }

   We do not include the module `dispatcher`, `world`, etc. because they are not public modules.

   Now, let's write the content.

   Important: remove empty lines and empty comment lines without text.

   Also, note: the crate doc in lib.rs has multiple lines. We should preserve them.

   Let's write to ai.md:

   We are creating a new file.

   We'll use a SEARCH/REPLACE block for `ai.md` with an empty SEARCH and the entire content as REPLACE.

   But note: the user may have added `ai.md` and it is empty? Yes, the provided content of ai.md is empty.

   Therefore, we can do:

ai.md

````

   We note:
      - The `#[derive(Default)]` for DispatcherBuilder is included.
      - For `Resource` trait, we note that the example in the instruction for a trait did not include the braces. We wrote `pub trait Resource: ... ;` without the braces and methods? Actually, in the example the trait had a method. Here the trait has no methods. We just end with a semicolon? Or we write the braces and nothing inside? The example ended with a semicolon for a trait without methods? Actually, in the example we wrote:

        pub trait MyTrait {
            /// Abc does stuff
            fn abc() -> Result<u32, ()>;
        }

      But for a trait without methods, we can write:

        pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}

      But note: the compiler allows either a semicolon or empty braces. However, the convention is to use braces.

      We used empty braces in the code, but here we are writing the signature. We follow the example in the instruction: the trait with methods was written with the braces and the method inside. For a trait without methods, we write:

        pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}

      So we change the line to:

        pub trait Resource: Send + Sync + 'static + Downcast {}

      Then, for `IntoSystem` we write:

        pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
            fn system(self) -> System;
        }

   Also, note that we included all the doc comments.

   We must be cautious: the `World::get_by_typeid` is marked with `#[doc(hidden)]`. We included it because the instruction said to include every public item. But we marked it with `#[doc(hidden)]` in the signature? The instruction said to include `#[derive(...)]` and `#[cfg(...)]`, but not `#[allow(...)]`. We include `#[doc(hidden)]` if present? Because the example included `#[derive(Debug, Display)]`. We should include all attributes that are not `#[allow(...)]`.

   Since `#[doc(hidden)]` is present and is not `#[allow(...)]`, we include it.

   We also note that the `AtomicRef` and `AtomicRefMut` types are from an external crate and are re-exported? Actually, they are not. We use them in the return types. The user must have `atomic_refcell_try` in scope? But we don't re-export. The generated documentation will show the fully qualified path? However, in the code we have:

        pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self) -> AtomicRef<T>;

   We don't see the re-export of `AtomicRef` in the code. We don't have `pub use atomic_refcell_try::*;` in lib.rs. So in the public API, we are using `AtomicRef` and `AtomicRefMut` without re-exporting. But the user must import `atomic_refcell_try` to use them? The documentation should reflect that.

   However, we are only writing the API as it is. We leave the return types as they appear in the code.

   Finally, note that the example struct `DispatcherBuilder` has no fields? We wrote:

        pub struct DispatcherBuilder;

   That is because we decided to skip the `systems` field because it has `#[doc(hidden)]`. But it's still a field. The example in the instruction skipped the private field `inner` in struct `A`. We are doing the same for `DispatcherBuilder`. However, the instruction says: "For example, for the following rust code: ... and we skipped the private field `inner`".

   So it's okay.

   We write the content as above.

   Let's generate the SEARCH/REPLACE block.

The changes involve creating a new `ai.md` file that documents the public API of the `world_dispatcher` crate. The documentation includes:

1. Crate name and version from Cargo.toml
2. Crate-level documentation from lib.rs
3. All public structs, traits and functions from:
   - dispatcher.rs (DispatcherBuilder, Dispatcher)
   - resource.rs (Resource trait)
   - world.rs (World)
   - system.rs (System, IntoSystem)

The documentation is organized into a root module section containing all public items. Private/internal items are excluded. Code blocks show exact signatures, doc comments, attributes, and module structure.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to create the documentation:

## Description of the crate
Notes about resources:
- Resources MUST implement default
- Resources MAY use Mutex<Arc<T>> to be Send+Sync
- Resources MUST be 'static

### Module `root`
```
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct DispatcherBuilder;
impl DispatcherBuilder {
    /// Creates a new `DispatcherBuilder`.
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    /// Adds a function implementing `IntoSystem` to the system pool.
    pub fn add<R, F: IntoSystem<R>>(self, into_system: F) -> Self;
    /// Adds a `System` to the system pool.
    pub fn add_system(self, system: System) -> Self;
    /// Builds a `Dispatcher` from the accumulated set of `System`.
    /// This preserves the order from the inserted systems.
    pub fn build(self, world: &mut World) -> Dispatcher;
}

    /// Returns an iterator of all stages. This is not needed for regular use,
    /// but can be useful for debugging or for implementing custom executors.

    /// Runs the systems one after the other, one at a time.
    pub fn run_seq(&mut self, world: &World);

    /// dependencies (the resource reference they use are the same and at least
    /// one is mutable) are run sequentially relative to each other, while
    /// systems without conflict run in parallel.

/// All types having a 'static lifetime automatically implement this.

    /// Initializes the resources required to run this system inside of the
    /// provided `World`, if those resources don't already exist.

    /// cases it is not required to call it manually.

/// Converts a function into a `System`. It is required to execute a function
/// automatically from `World`'s resources.
/// This trait is automatically implemented for functions taking 12 arguments (22 if using the
/// `big_systems` feature)
/// or less where:
/// - All arguments are immutable or mutable references.
/// - All immutable references are placed *before* all mutable references.
/// - All arguments implement `Default`.
/// - Does not use the same type twice.
pub trait IntoSystem<R> {
    fn system(self) -> System;
