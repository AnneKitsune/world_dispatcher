#### I want you to analyze the code and documentation given to you. Analyze my coding style and write down instructions for an AI to replicate my style. Also think about any lessons from this code you can learn and write them down. Write both the style and lessons in lessons.txt

# Coding Style Guide

## General Style
1. Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions and types
2. Prefer explicit code over clever tricks
3. Document public APIs thoroughly with Rustdoc comments
4. Keep line lengths reasonable (typically under 100 chars)
5. Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
6. Place imports at top of file (except test modules)

## Rust Specifics
1. Use derive macros (Default, Debug) where appropriate
2. Implement traits explicitly rather than blanket impls when possible
3. Use Result types for error handling rather than panics
4. Document error conditions clearly in docs
5. Use generics and traits to create flexible APIs
6. Prefer atomic_refcell over Mutex for thread-safe interior mutability

## Documentation Style
1. Include examples in docs showing common usage
2. Document limitations and edge cases
3. Use markdown formatting in docs
4. Include crate-level docs explaining overall purpose
5. Document feature flags and their effects
6. Include maintainer/contact info in README

## Testing Style
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Test edge cases explicitly
3. Include wasm-bindgen-test for WASM compatibility
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Test both success and error paths
6. Benchmark performance-critical code

## Lessons Learned

1. The power of Rust's type system for safe ECS implementation:
   - TypeId for runtime type checking
   - Generics for flexible system functions
   - Traits for clean abstraction boundaries

2. Importance of clear error handling:
   - Distinct error types for different failure modes
   - Macros to simplify error creation
   - Documenting expected error conditions

3. Performance considerations:
   - AtomicRefCell for thread-safe access
   - Careful system staging for parallel execution
   - Benchmarking different approaches

4. API design principles:
   - Builder pattern for complex construction
   - Feature flags for opt-in complexity
   - Clear documentation of requirements/limitations

5. Testing methodology:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for combined behavior
   - WASM compatibility testing
   - Benchmarking performance characteristics
