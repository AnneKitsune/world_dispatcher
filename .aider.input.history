+I want you to analyze the code and documentation given to you. Analyze my coding style and write down instructions for an AI to replicate my style. Also think about any lessons from this code you can learn and write them down. Write both the style and lessons in lessons.txt

+Go through the entirety of the code. For every single public struct, trait and function, write down the signature and doc comments in ai.md. Make sure to include the crate-level documentation too. Finally, include the crate name and version from Cargo.toml.

+For example, for the following rust code:
+```

+When deciding which module something is part of, always view it from the crate user's perspective, taking re-exports into account, and always use the one closest to the root module (lib.rs or main.rs)
